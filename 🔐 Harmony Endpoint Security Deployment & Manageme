🧩 Overview
This project highlights the core components of deploying and managing Check Point Harmony Endpoint Security in both cloud and on-premise environments. The work was performed using real-world scenarios involving silent installations, policy enforcement, and exclusion tuning to balance security and operational flexibility.

🏗️ System Architecture
Client-Side:
Harmony Endpoint agents installed on endpoints (Windows, Linux).
Clients located globally (remote, roaming users).

Server-Side:
SmartEndpoint Management Server:
Deployment Modes: Cloud or On-Premises

Management Tools:
SmartConsole
Web Management Portal

Connection Flow:
css
Endpoint Agent ↔ Harmony SmartEndpoint Server ↔ Security Engine & Cloud Services

🚀 Deployment Strategy
Installation Options:
Nano Agent (Dropper): Minimal installer that downloads full packages.
Standalone Package: Full offline installer for restricted environments.

Installation Modes:
Silent Install: Agent installs without user intervention.
Interactive Install: User must approve installation.

Linux Installation Steps:
bash
chmod +x install_script.sh
./install_script.sh

Portal Deployment:
Choose agent version
Assign capability profiles (Threat Prevention, Compliance, etc.)
Select platform (Windows/Linux)
Push deployment policy

🔄 Client-Server Communication
Clients sync with the server every 60 seconds.
Policy or status changes are pushed immediately.

Server visibility includes:
Endpoint health
Agent versioning
Threat alerts

Ports and Services:
Refer to Check Point documentation for the full list of required outbound ports and domains.

⚙️ Policy Configuration
Modes:
Computer Mode: Policy is assigned per device.
User Mode: Policy follows users across multiple devices.

Policy Components:
Capability toggles (Threat Prevention, Anti-Ransomware, etc.)
Custom rules for departments (e.g. stricter policies for Finance)
Threat emulation and file scanning policies

Example:
yaml

Copy
Edit
Policy:
  Finance:
    - Disk Encryption: Enabled
    - Threat Emulation: Strict
  R&D:
    - Disk Encryption: Disabled
    - Logging: Extended

🛡️ Exclusion Management
Use Case:
Exclude legitimate backup or compression software from being flagged as ransomware.

Types of Exclusions:
URL Filtering: Add safe domains
File Scanning: Add folders, file hashes
Process-Level: Exclude applications

Reference:
Used Microsoft Defender exclusion list to configure trusted locations and apps.
All exclusions aligned with capability-based exclusions in Harmony.


📜 Key Logs and Troubleshooting
Endpoint logs filtered for:
Threat detections
Installation events
Communication failures

Used Threat Hunting feature to:
Track incident source
Map affected systems
Identify recurring threat patterns

🔍 Connectivity Test Utility
Introduced in version 85.10
Executable .exe file for client testing

Verifies:
Connectivity to Harmony Cloud
Port accessibility
DNS and certificate resolution

Usage:
bash
Run as Admin: ConnectivityTest.exe
Output highlights blocked services with suggested firewall changes.
